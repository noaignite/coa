# Formatting & IntelliSense

## Formatting with Prettier plugins

For an improved authoring experience you can look into installing these prettier pluggins. These dependencies should be installed at the webroot of your repo as dev dependencies.

```bash
yarn add -DW prettier-plugin-style-order prettier-plugin-organize-imports prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
```

Now we need to configure the installed pluggins. Create a `prettier.config.js` in the webroot and add the configuration as described below.

```js
module.exports = {
  // Include Prettier plugins. Include order matters.
  plugins: [
    'prettier-plugin-style-order',
    'prettier-plugin-organize-imports',
    'prettier-plugin-tailwindcss', // MUST come last.
  ],
  // Include the Tailwind configuration file.
  tailwindConfig: './packages/tailwind-config/tailwind.config.ts',
  // Allow `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` to run for these functions.
  tailwindFunctions: ['clsx', 'cva'],
  // Prettier formatting rules can be added below.
}
```
